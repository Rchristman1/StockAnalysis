# Overview of Project
In module two, we learned how to use the VBS software in excel. While learning this softwware we were able to make our own codes with the data we were given. After uisng th codes to get what we needed, we were able to comapare, and analysize the information to help Steve with what he needed.

After getting our results from the the data, we had two sets of results for 2017 and 2018. In 2018 our code ran for  282.9922 seconds for that year, and in 2017 the code ran for 0.0703125 seconds. In 2018 AY, CSIQ, DQ, FSLR,HASI,JKS,SEDG,SPWR,TERP,VSLR were all in the red and ENPH, and RUN were in the green. In 2017 though, AY, CSIQ, DQ, FSLR,HASI,JKS,SEDG,SPWR,VSLR,ENPH, and RUN were all green except for one which was TERP.![2022-11-07 (4)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115179728/200945332-24649a04-9d16-4e74-8c51-49fecfac923f.png)![2022-11-07 (2)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115179728/200945350-14286984-f761-49a3-9d6d-2b34f9201162.png)


# Summary
There are a couple cons and pros to refactoring code. A advantage for it is that it better comprehensibility facilitates maintenance and the extendibility of the software. However a disadvantage of refactoring code is that you can be Imprecise refactoring the code and it could introduce new bugs and errors into the code. In the code we were able to refacotr it and get the data that we needed, However it did take up a bit of time.
